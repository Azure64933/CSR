APEX has always believed 
that a sustainable enterprise must 
not only excel in its core business 
and pursue the highest revenues, 
profits, and shareholder returns,  
it must also fulfill its responsibilities 
to the environment and society, 
and serve as an uplifting force in 
society.
 
In 2015, APEX established 
its Corporate Social Responsibility 
Policy, aiming to build on a foundation 
of sustainable operations and  
carry out our three missions of  
“Corporate Governance”, “Sustainable  
Environment”, and “Social Care” in  
our daily operations. We gain 
understanding of the key issues 
of concern for our stakeholders 
through organizations in our  
company responsible for these  
issues, and try our best to disclose 
the results of our actions through 
Company announcements.
 
Economic Dimension
 
In 2016, APEX continued to set milestones in revenues and profit despite a volatile global 
economy with our pro-active sales strategy and cost control. This enabled us to keep issuing 
the Company’s cash dividend to shareholders with 50% of annual EPS.
 
As the Top 2 rigid PCB manufacturer in Thailand, APEX hopes to leverage its hard-won 
leadership position in the industry and move our supply chain towards sustainable  
operations. We were making labor and environmental standards a part of our audits and  
requiring suppliers to follow the EICC Code of Conduct.
 
Environmental Dimension
 
In addition to achieving our targets in energy saving, water conservation, waste reduction, 
and other environmental goals for the next 3 years, APEX plans to set up renewable energy 
supply device, wastewater reuse and carbon footprint inventories and disclosures, and to 
obtain third-party accreditation.
 
Social Dimension
 
Our focus is on employee rights and social participation. Employees are APEX’s  
greatest asset, and we pay close attention to their physical and mental health as well as  
their work environment. Each factory must maintain the ISO 14001 and the OHSAS 18001 
(occupational health and safety) management system standards. In 2016, we provided more 
than 5,400 job opportunities, and retained talent with competitive compensation, diverse  
training courses, vacation time above regulatory requirements, and an array of work-life  
balance measures.
 
 We take the initiative to care for employees, and our employees are happy to give  
back to society after work, creating a positive cycle to make society better. In 2016, APEX  
provided  book donations to schools, blood/money/supplies donation to hospitals, and work 
opportunities to blind people among other things.
 
Progress Towards a Sustainable Future
 
Corporate Social Responsibility encompasses the three dimensions of economy,  
society and the environment. In this period of volatility for the global economy and environment, 
fulfilling corporate social responsibility not only supports the fundamentals of our operations 
and reduces or eliminates risk, it also builds sustainable value for APEX and its stakeholders. 
In 2017, APEX was chosen by Taiwan TWSE to be the member of “Corporate Governance 
Index 100” from more than 800 listing companies. APEX pledges itself to not only become  
an indispensable influence in the semiconductor industry, but also to serve as a force for  
sustainability that pushes society forward, to become a corporate citizen with a positive  
influence on society, and to build a better future for the next generation.

Competitive edges
A. Excellent corporate management 
 
  Apex’s management is dedicated to 
the company, maintains business stability and 
growth, endeavors in sustenance of internal 
communication channels, and also adheres 
to five major management concepts: 1. finest 
quality, 2. best prices, 3. punctual deliveries, 4. 
excellent service and 5. fulfillment of promises.
B. Diversification of client sources and 
 
product applications
 
  Apex’s client spread around Japan,  
Korea, Europe, North America and China and 
major international manufacturers are among 
the end-customers. Diversification of client 
sources reduces the influence of the economic 
situation of a single country or region on Apex. 
In the meantime, diversification of product 
applications, including electronic products, 
computer-related, communications and automo-
tive products, will enable Apex to stand out as a 
company capable of meeting the various needs 
of clients and its product development can also 
create complementary effects. 
Advantageous and disadvantageous factors  
in future development and countermeasures
Advantageous factors
(1) Geography and people of Thailand
 
  Compared to other regions outside mainland  
China, Thailand has a more competitive edge. Being an  
ASEAN member state, it has regional economic  
advantages that attract foreign investors. With the  
integration of AEC in 2015, Thailand will continue to  
enjoy advantage of exporting into South East Asia and  
doing cross border trade with zero tariffs. Thai people  
are friendly and loyal. This has made it possible for Apex  
to maintain the average job separation rate below 4%. 
(2)  Labor cost and labor consciousness
 
  Despite the Thai government’s announcement in  
recent years to raise the minimum wage, Apex has been 
able to keep management costs at a lower level through  
cost control. Fully aware that the lower labor cost in Thailand 
is a major contribution to its gross profit, Apex has therefore 
continued to increase investment in automation to reduce  
its dependence on labor in the future. We have also  
invested in automated equipment to reduce the cost  
of intensive labor.
(3)  Market share and demand  
 
  Apex understands very well that cost  competitiveness,  
decent service and responsibilities are necessary abilities 
for the company to survive in the electronics industry, keep 
customers and develop new sources of clients. We have 
continued to expand our market share through current  
customers and seek new ones to fill the production  
capacity of the new plants. Besides continuous acquisition 
of machine equipment for the new plants, Apex also makes 
persistent efforts in development of new products and  
technologies to bring up production to meet market demand 
as well as win opportunities to serve more customers and 
increase business. Apex has price advantages to compete 
in the market and continues to maintain close relationships 
with customers and develop new sources of clients. 
C. Cost control and product price
 
  Complicated production processes 
and production according to orders are the 
characteristics in PCB’s manufacturing. 
Hence, precise and effective manage-
ment are the foundation for maintenance 
of competitiveness and creation of profit. 
Whole production processes of PCB are in-
house, so Apex can control the scrap rate 
of each work-station and thus decrease 
producing cost. At the same time, Apex has 
centralized sale and procurement so as to 
reduce time lag. Finally, good cost control 
has resulted in competitive product price.

(4)  Competitive edges of PCB manufacturers in Asia
 
  In recent years, production costs have kept rising in China 
as a consequence of growing labor costs which are subject to 
the policy of the Chinese government. Plus the increasingly strict 
environmental protection policy, PCB businesses along the eastern 
coast have begun to relocate to the inland. Although production 
costs in the Chinese inland are relatively lower, the hardware 
facilities and logistic services are not as progressive as those 
in the eastern region. This has created certain pressure on our 
competitors. Being based in Thailand gives Apex certain relative 
advantages. 
(5)  Logistic advantages in Thailand
 
  Today, the land transportation systems in Thailand  
have been greatly improved. Moving goods from Thailand 
to anywhere in China takes only 7-10 days. Delivery time 
is shortened, costs are reduced, and competitiveness  
is boosted. For raw materials, there are four suppliers able to pro-
vide board materials. Apex also purchases services needed for 
production from Thailand suppliers to cut down on waiting time. 
Countermeasures
 
  Apex continues to improve sales tactics to maintain plant  
utilization rates at over 90% and is therefore able to offer competitive  
prices and ensure reasonable profit. Increased customer demand for  
multi-layer boards will boost our average sales price and profitability.
Production of 2-layer boards continues to decrease while that of 
multi-layer boards is on the rise. This enables us to cope with  
competition from other regions. 
(3)   Impact on profitability from exchange rate  fluctuations
 
  
Exchange gains/losses will have an impact on the final profit  
of the company. By adopting natural hedging strategies and  
cautious operation of certain derivatives, Apex has reduced the  
likely impact from exchange rate fluctuations by a large margin. 
(4)  International raw material price fluctuations
 
  
Apex takes active measures to negotiate prices with suppliers  
of important raw materials, such as CCL, Prepreg, copper foil,  
solutions and dry film. 
 
  
Apex as a PCB manufacturer. The main raw materials needed  
are substrates, copper foil and prepreg which are purchased from  
various suppliers in Asia, including Taiyo Ink, Nan Ya Plastics,  
Western, and King Board Chemical. These are all major suppliers  
with a good reputation and have kept a decent and stable  
supply-demand relationship with Apex. The prices they offer also  
can appropriately reflect the trends in the electronics market.  
We are foreseeing that relevant materials to PCB may be  
oversupplied in 2017; especially price of copper may go down a lot.  
However, it still depends on China’s new residential construction.
Disadvantageous factors
(1) Awakening of environmental protection awareness
 
  Apex has implemented a number of projects in recent years, 
including power and waste water treatment facilities, to reduce  
environmental impacts. We believe the rate of return on investment  
of these projects will be worthwhile. Overall, we have seen initial 
results. We will continue our effort to control costs to ensure that  
the funds spent on environmental protection will not affect the  
profitability of the company. 
Countermeasures
 
  Apex continues to improve production processes to reduce  
contamination, adopt environmental strategies and bring in  
contamination prevention equipment to meet environmental protection 
regulations, and also commission qualified environmental  
protection businesses to dispose of contaminated waste to reduce 
environmental contamination and environmental protection expenses. 
(2) Fierce market competition
 
  The PCB industry is the mother of the electronics industry.  
Price reduction pressure from customers never stops and this is  
the fate of this industry.

Organization Profile 
 
  The main axis of Apex culture is “Oriental 
Thinking collaborating with Western  
Management” while working. “Oriental Thinking”  
means to treat others with sensibility. At the 
same time, the concept of “benevolence” is  
definitely helpful for Apex and is the foundation  
to achieve harmony and olerance among 
teams. Apex people have to keep empathy  
in mind all the time in order to understand the 
 opposite side’s point of view. Then, effectiveness  
of communication can be created and we can 
further achieve operating goals. “Western 
Management” emphasizes spirit of compliance 
of regulation. Apex people have to comply  
with laws, regulations and internal control  
system precisely and carefully as a 
foundation for maintaining competitiveness.
 
Apex is a professional manufacturer  
of PCB and  has over fifty-five hundred  
employees, most of whom are of Thai 
nationality. Apex has two factories in  
Samutsakhon which is located south-west  
of Bangkok. Apex has focused on 2 to 10  
layers of PCB’s products and monthly  
capacities of over forty thousand square  
meters. In 2016, the consolidated revenue  
and operating profit were 8,585 million NT  
dollars and 443 million NT dollars, respectively.
Business of Apex and its 
subsidiaries
 
  The main business operations of  
Apex Group are production and sales of  
double-sided and multi-layer rigid printed 
circuit boards (PCBs). The products are  
sold locally in Thailand and also exported to 
25 countries in different parts of the world, 
including China, Korea, Latin America (Brazil), 
South Africa, Russia, Tunisia, Europe and USA.
 
  Consumer electronics makers that are  
clients of the group include Samsung, Arris, 
Technicolor, Hewlett-Packard, Canon, Toshiba 
and Western digital. The PCBs produced  
by the group are mainly applied in LCD TVs,  
STBs, hard disks, printers, wireless  
transmitters, TFT panels, and multimedia 
products for automobiles. 
New product and service items to be 
developed
 
  The consumer products like LCD 
TV, set top boxes and home entertainment  
market continuemoderate growth in 2016.  
Almost all Japanese brand name makers face  
reduced market share. However, products 
such as mobile phones and Personal computers  
have faced decline.
 
  We have already started to approach 
and/or develop new products for automotive 
parts, mini WI-FI, RF application products 
and PCB transformer products, etc. These 
products will enable us to take advantage of  
our new facility and upgraded manufacturing  
capabilities especially automotive and  
notebook and expect to see further  
improvements in 2017 onwards.
 
  On the other hand, our factories also  
have enhanced facilities to provide our  
customer with more surface finishing options  
like Immersion Tin, Lead-free HASL, Carbon 
finishing. Due to market design continuously 
reducing PCB size, higher holes density and 
thinner line width spacing, the use of Via-in-
pad technology in rigid boards are growing 
and factories have also added this capability 
to keep up with market trends.

GHG emission
 
  APEX is aware of global concerns on 
the climate change and Green House Gases 
(GHG) emissions and materiality for all  
organizational departments to take action on  
GHG emission reduction. In the year 2016, 
APEX has established the first GHG inventory  
as initial review for materiality in this issue.  
This information then leads to company  
objective in energy conservation and GHG 
emission reduction as tentative for 5% GHG 
emission reduction within the next 5 years. 
 
  APEX operations mainly consumed 
electrical energy for manufacturing and power  
supply, working on energy conservation  
program led to gradual decrease in both  
energy consumption and GHG inventory. 
Smart control and saving of energy: in 2016,  
Apex co-operated with vendors to propose  
the 30% improvement of electricity  
consumption efficiency which focuses on 
compressor/air conditioner systems. It may  
be realized in the  year 2017.  
 
 
  Other type of GHG concerns are  
from the supply chain, while APEX chose  
to establish GHG scope 3 inventory for  
premium freight as initial information. APEX  
is expecting to expand the inventory for all  
mode of transportation and evaluate 
appropriate work with supplier to control of 
GHG scope 3.
 
  Apex has established GHG inventory  
in the year 2016 applying TGO-CFO (Thailand  
Green  House  Gases  Management  Organization  
- Carbon footprint for Organization) scheme 
(as equivalent to ISO14064-1:2006) as  
reporting standard. This standard covers 
the report of Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane 
(CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O) as applicable to  
consolidation of Apex’s operational control 
approach.

committees as joined management-worker 
groups namely OHSAS 18001 working groups  
and Safety & Occupational committee (as per 
Thai regulation) which total a number of 260

Protective measures for work 
environments and employees’ safety
 
  Apex Group has set up a safety division 
which regularly inspects whether the work  
environments comply with safety regulations 
to minimize workplace safety hazards. Apex

physical checkups, hoping that they can be 
aware of their health condition and employees’ 
physical and mental health can be improved.

injury rate) for APT were 81 times - base on  
normalize of 18,000,000 man hours. By  
reviewed the working environment under 
APT operation, we have no workers who are 
involved in occupational activities who  
have a high incidence or high risk of specific  
diseases.
 
  Apex’s subsidiary APT has also passed 
the OHSAS 18001 certification because of the  
fine healthy and safe work environment it  
created. The initiative for the year 2016 was

LRQA Assurance Statement 
Relating to APEX International Company Limited’s Sustainability Report for 
the calendar year 2016 
 
This Assurance Statement has been prepared for APEX International Company Limited in accordance with 
our contract but is intended for the readers of this Report.  
 
Terms of Engagement  
Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by APEX International Company Limited 
(APEX) to provide independent assurance on its Sustainability Report 2016 (“the Report”) against the 
assurance criteria below to a moderate level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgment 
of the verifier using AccountAbility’s AA1000AS (2008)), where the scope was a Type 2 engagement. 
 
Our assurance engagement covered APEX operations and activities in Thailand, China and Taiwan.  Our 
engagement specifically covered the following requirements: 
 
Evaluating adherence to AA1000 AccountAbility Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness 
 
Confirming that the report is in accordance with GRI G4’s Reporting Guidelines and core option 
 
Evaluating the reliability of data and information for the selected specific standard disclosures listed 
below: 
- 
Direct Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions (Scope 1), (G4-EN15) 
- 
Energy indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emission (Scope 2), (G4-EN16).  
 
LRQA’s responsibility is only to APEX. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in 
the end footnote. APEX’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data 
and information within the report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which 
the report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of APEX. 
 
LRQA’s Opinion  
Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that APEX has 
not: 
 
Met the requirements above 
 
Disclosed reliable performance data and information for the selected specific standard disclosures 
 
Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report. 
The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a moderate level of assurance and at the materiality of the 
professional judgement of the Verifier.  
Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a moderate level assurance engagement is less than for a high level assurance engagement.  
Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites. 
LRQA’s Approach  
LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with AA1000AS (2008).  The following tasks 
though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement: 
 
Reviewing APEX’s stakeholder engagement process by checking the information collected from the 
stakeholder fora. 
 
Evaluating APEX’s process for assessing material issues.  We did this by comparing their issues against 
our own independent analysis and checking that the right issues were included in their Report.    
 
Interviewing senior management and key personnel to understand APEX’s processes for the selection, 
reporting and use of performance data. 
 
Auditing APEX’s data management systems and supporting evidence to confirm that there were no 
significant errors, omissions or misstatements in the Report.  We did this by: 
- 
Reviewing the effectiveness of data handling process, and systems, including those for internal 
verification at their factory in Samutsakorn, Thailand. 
- 
Reviewing assumptions, calculation methodologies and the setting of operational boundaries.   
Note:  
LRQA did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by 
individual locations.  
 
Checking that the GRI Content index allows stakeholders to access performance indicators.

Observations  
Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are: 
 
Stakeholder inclusivity:  
We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from APEX”s stakeholder 
process. However, APEX should maintain relevant evidences to further demonstrate its effectiveness 
and inclusiveness. 
 
Materiality: 
We are not aware of any material issues concerning APEX’s sustainability performance that have been 
excluded from the Report. However, we believed that the risk criteria established for determining 
material issues should be assessed together with their potential impacts to ensure that they are not 
biased to APEX’s management.  
 
Comparability:  
APEX had reported information in a manner that enables stakeholders to analyse changes in their 
performance over time, and that could support analysis relative to its peers. 
 
Reliability; 
Although APEX had a data collection system, we believed that  APEX should continue improving the 
system across all business functions to further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the performance 
data and information.  
 
Completeness 
We are not aware that APEX had not provided a complete presentation of its material aspects and their 
boundaries. However, APEX should consider establishing internal verification controls to ensure that 
there are no omission of relevant information that are material to its stakeholders. 
 
LRQA’s competence and independence 
LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and 
experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by 
senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent. 
 
This verification is the only work undertaken by LRQA for APEX and as such does not compromise our 
independence or impartiality.
